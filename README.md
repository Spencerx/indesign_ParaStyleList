ParaStyleList for InDesign
==========================

NOTE: Has not yet been extensively tested.

Creates a list of the paragraph styles in use in the document, along with the page number of the first page on which each style occurs.

Additionally, compiles page numbers into a list at the bottom, for the purpose of creating PDF sample pages.

Mac Users: Install in Macintosh HD/Applications/Adobe InDesign FOO/Scripts/Scripts Panel/

Big thanks to Dave Saunders for releasing some code to get this started, in a valuable script that prints a list of styles in use, styled with its own style (so meta): http://indesignsecrets.com/scripted-style-lists.php
